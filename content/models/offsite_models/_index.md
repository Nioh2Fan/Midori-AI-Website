All of these models originate from outside of the Midori AI model repository, and are not subject to the vetting process of Midori AI, although they are compatible with the model installer.

Note that some of these models may deviate from our conventional model formatting standards (Quantized/Non-Quantized), and will be served using a rounding-down approach. For instance, if you request a Q8 model and none is available, the Q6 model will be served instead, and so on.
