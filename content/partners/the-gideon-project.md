### Sophisticated Simplicity
The Gideon Project (TGP) is a company dedicated to creating custom personalized AI solutions for smaller businesses and enterprises to enhance workflow efficiency in their production. Where others target narrow and specialized domains, we aim to provide a versatile solution that enables a broader range of applications. TGP is about making AI technology available to businesses that could benefit from it, but do not know how to deploy it or may not even have considered how they might benefit from it yet. 

Our flagship AI 'Gideon' can be hard-coded or dynamic - if the client has a repetitive task that theyâ€™d like automated, this can be accomplished extremely simply through a Gideon instance. Additionally, Gideon is 24/7 available for use for customers thanks to Midori AI's services. Our servers work in a redundant setup, to minimize downtime as backup servers are in place to take over the workload, should a server fail. This does not translate to 100% uptime, but does reduce downtime significantly. 

### What makes TGP stand out from other AI-service companies?
TGP puts customer experience at the top of our priorities. While a lot of focus is being put into our products and services, we aim to provide the most simplistic setup process for our clients. From that comes our motto 'Sophisticaed Simplicity'. TGP will meet the clients in person to create common grounds and understandings regarding the model capabilities, and then proceed to create the model without further disturbing the client. Once finished, the client will get a test link to verify functionality and see if the iteration is satisfactory before it is pushed from test environment to production environment. If the client wishes to change features or details in their iteration, all they need to do is reach out, and TGP will handle the rest. This ensures the client goes through minimal trouble with the setup and maintenance process. 


Overall, TGP is the perfect solution for your own startup or webshop where you need automated features. Whether that is turning on the coffee machine or managing complex data within your own custom database, Gideon can be programmed to accomplish a variety of tasks, and TGP will be by your side throughout the entire process.
